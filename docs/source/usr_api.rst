MBIRJAX is designed to give reconstructions using just a few lines of code.

The first step is to create an instance with a specific geometry. This is done by initializing a class such as

.. autosummary::

   mbirjax.ParallelBeamModel

:ref:`ParallelBeamModelDocs` and classes for other geometries are derived from :ref:`TomographyModelDocs`, which includes several methods
for manipulating sinograms and reconstructions.

.. autosummary::

   mbirjax.TomographyModel.recon
   mbirjax.TomographyModel.forward_project
   mbirjax.TomographyModel.back_project
   mbirjax.TomographyModel.reshape_recon
   mbirjax.TomographyModel.set_params
   mbirjax.TomographyModel.get_params
   mbirjax.TomographyModel.gen_weights
   mbirjax.TomographyModel.gen_3d_sl_phantom
   mbirjax.TomographyModel.print_params
