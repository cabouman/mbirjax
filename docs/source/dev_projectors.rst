Projectors

The ``Projectors`` class uses the low-level projection functions
implemented in a specific geometry in order to override

* :meth:`mbirjax.TomographyModel.sparse_forward_project`
* :meth:`mbirjax.TomographyModel.sparse_back_project`
* :meth:`mbirjax.TomographyModel.compute_hessian_diagonal`

The ``Projectors`` class provides JAX-specific code using vmap and scan along with batching along pixels and
views in order to provide code that balances memory-efficiency with time-efficiency.
