**MBIRJAX: Wrong Rotation Direction Demo**

See the [MBIRJAX documentation](https://mbirjax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for an overview and details.  

This script demonstrates the effects of an incorrect rotation direction when using cone beam projection.  

For this demo, we do a baseline reconstruction with the correct specification of angles, then reverse the order of the angles and perform another reconstruction.  

Since this problem doesn't arise with parallel beam because of symmetry, we show this only for cone beam.   

See [demo_1_shepp_logan.py](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zG_H6CDjuQxeMRQHan3XEyX2YVKcSSNC) for the basic steps of synthetic sinogram generation and reconstruction.

"""**Data generation:** For demo purposes, we create a phantom and then project it to create a sinogram.

For this demo we use the default recon shape for cone beam.

Note:  the sliders on the viewer won't work in notebook form.  For that you'll need to run the python code with an interactive matplotlib backend, typcially using the command line or a development environment like Spyder or Pycharm to invoke python.
