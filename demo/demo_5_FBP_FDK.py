**MBIRJAX: FBP and FDK Reconstruction Demo**

See the [MBIRJAX documentation](https://mbirjax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for an overview and details.  

This script demonstrates the MBIRJAX code by creating a 3D phantom inspired by Shepp-Logan, forward projecting it to create a sinogram, and then using MBIRJAX to perform Filtered Back Projection (FBP) for parallel beam reconstruction and Feldkamp-Davis-Kress reconstruction (FDK) for cone beam reconstruntion.

For the demo, we create some synthetic data by first making a phantom, then forward projecting it to obtain a sinogram.  

In a real application, you would load your sinogram as a numpy array and use numpy.transpose if needed so that it
has axes in the order (views, rows, channels).  For reference, assuming the rotation axis is vertical, then increasing the row index nominally moves down the rotation axis and increasing the channel index moves to the right as seen from the source.

Select a GPU as runtime type for best performance.
