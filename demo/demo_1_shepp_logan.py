**MBIRJAX: Basic Demo**

See the [MBIRJAX documentation](https://mbirjax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for an overview and details.  

This script demonstrates the basic MBIRJAX code by creating a 3D phantom inspired by Shepp-Logan, forward projecting it to create a sinogram, and then using MBIRJAX to perform a Model-Based, Multi-Granular Vectorized Coordinate Descent reconstruction.

For the demo, we create some synthetic data by first making a phantom, then forward projecting it to obtain a sinogram.  

In a real application, you would load your sinogram as a numpy array and use numpy.transpose if needed so that it
has axes in the order (views, rows, channels).  For reference, assuming the rotation axis is vertical, then increasing the row index nominally moves down the rotation axis and increasing the channel index moves to the right as seen from the source.

Select a GPU as runtime type for best performance.
