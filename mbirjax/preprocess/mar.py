    """
    This function generates generalized Huber weights based on the method described in the referenced notes.
    It adds robustness by treating any element where ``|sino_error / weights| > T`` as an outlier,
    down-weighting it according to the generalized Huber function.

    The function returns new `ghuber_weights`.

    Typically, to obtain the final robust weights, the `ghuber_weights` should be multiplied by the original `weights`:

        final_weights = weights * ghuber_weights

    Args:
        weights: jnp.ndarray of shape (views, rows, cols):
            Initial weights, typically derived from inverse variance estimates.
        sino_error: jnp.ndarray of shape (views, rows, cols):
            Sinogram error array representing deviations from the model.
        T: float, optional (default=1.0):
            Threshold parameter; values greater than T are treated as outliers.
        delta: float, optional (default=1.0):
            Controls the strength of the generalized Huber function (delta=1 corresponds to the conventional Huber).
        epsilon: float, optional (default=1e-6):
            Small number to avoid division by zero.

    Returns:
        huber_weights: jnp.ndarray of shape (views, rows, cols)
            The computed generalized Huber weights.

    Beam-hardening correction for objects containing a combination of plastic and metal.

    The function takes the measured sinogram and initial reconstruction as input, and it returns a corrected sinogram.

    The metal and plastic materials are each assumed to be composed of a single material.
    However, it should work fine for a combination of different plastics as long as their optical density properites do not vary too much.
