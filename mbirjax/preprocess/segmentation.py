    Segment an image into multiple intensity classes using Otsu's method.

    This function computes optimal threshold values that divide an image into the specified

            Input image as a NumPy array of floating-point values.
        classes (int, optional):
            Number of classes to divide the image into. Must be â‰¥ 2. Defaults to 2.

            A list of `classes - 1` threshold values, given in increasing order. These thresholds
